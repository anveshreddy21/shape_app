# shape_app

A new Flutter project for Geometrical shape recognition on canvas

## Getting Started

This categorizes the drawn shape into one of the following geometrical shapes:
  Circle
  Ellipse
  Right-angled triangle
  perpendicular triangle
  equilateral triangle
  Isosceles triangle
  Scalene triangle
  Square
  Rectangle
  Parallelogram
  Trapezium
  Rhombus
  Any higher-order regular polygon
  Irregular polygon
  Polyline
  Curve

Then it rerenders the perfected shape on the canvas.
